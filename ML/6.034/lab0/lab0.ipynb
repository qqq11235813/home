    "# Section 3: Algebraic simplification\n",
    "\n",
    "# This code implements a simple computer algebra system, which takes in an\n",
    "# expression made of nested sums and products, and simplifies it into a\n",
    "# single sum of products. The goal is described in more detail in the\n",
    "# problem set writeup.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Much of this code is already implemented. We provide you with a\n",
    "# representation for sums and products, and a top-level simplify() function\n",
    "# which applies the associative law in obvious cases. For example, it\n",
    "# turns both (a + (b + c)) and ((a + b) + c) into the simpler expression\n",
    "# (a + b + c).\n",
    "\n",
    "# However, the code has a gap in it: it cannot simplify expressions that are\n",
    "# multiplied together. In interesting cases of this, you will need to apply\n",
    "# the distributive law.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your goal is to fill in the do_multiply() function so that multiplication\n",
    "# can be simplified as intended. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing will be mathematical:  If you return a flat list that\n",
    "# evaluates to the same value as the original expression, you will\n",
    "# get full credit.\n",
